## ðŸš€ How It Works Now

### Automatic Deployment
- **Triggers on**: Push to `master` branch
- **Also runs on**: Push to `develop` branch (for testing)
- **Pull requests**: Against `master` branch

### Deployment Process
1. **Push to master** â†’ Triggers GitHub Actions
2. **Tests run** â†’ Automated testing with PostgreSQL
3. **Build application** â†’ Maven build with production JAR
4. **Deploy to cloud** â†’ Automatic deployment to your chosen platform
5. **Health checks** â†’ Verify deployment success

### Commands to Deploy
```bash
# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to master branch (triggers deployment)
git push origin master
```

## ðŸ“‹ What's Ready

- âœ… **GitHub Actions** configured for `master` branch
- âœ… **All cloud platforms** set up for `master` branch deployment
- âœ… **Documentation** updated to reflect `master` branch
- âœ… **Setup scripts** updated with `master` branch instructions

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit with master branch CI/CD"
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Watch the magic happen**:
   - GitHub Actions will automatically run
   - Tests will execute
   - Application will build
   - Deployment will trigger (if you've set up cloud platform)

3. **Set up your cloud platform**:
   - Choose from Railway, Render, Heroku, or Vercel
   - Follow the deployment guide
   - Set environment variables
   - Enjoy automatic deployments!
